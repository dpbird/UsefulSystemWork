This is a quick tool for generate a full roster for courses which have multiple sections. I typically use it when I have a 2 section course which also has 2 waitlists. 

HOW TO USE:
Add all of your csv rosters downloaded from S3 to a directory named "Rosters". It will output a file "Generated Full Roster X Students.csv" where X is the total number of students.
